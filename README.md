Laboratory projects from the "Fundamentos de Redes" course.

This Repository have 5 parts wich are 5 exercises about the same concept but using differents methods:

1.Fill the gaps in the files <ServidorIterativo.java>(Server) and <Cliente.java>(client) for make them work like a iterative TCP client/server

2.Modify the previous client and server for make them use the PrintWriter and BufferedReader classes

3.Modify the previous server for make it work as a concurrent server.

4.Modify the client and server for make them use UDP datagrams.

5. Creation and definition of a application protocol using the client/server paradigm. I did the simulation of an activity monitor where you put manually the information of the monitor and the server give you a result.
